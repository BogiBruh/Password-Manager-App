# Password Manager App (name subject to change)
This C# WinForms project I'm writing to see if I'm able to create a functional and full fledged (small scope) application.
</br>It's like Dashlaneâ„¢ but worse, with local storage(not yet), and frankly not worth a cent.

<a href="https://www.haveibeenpwned.com">Have you been pwned?</a> Did you ever wonder "Awh man, I really need a more secure password, but I can't remember them nor write them in a notebook"? Lucky you, because I've got a(n unfinished) product you probably shouldn't use!
# Functionality
With this application you can:
<li>generate and store(not yet) secure passwords with a state of the art (basic) randomly generated string of characters,</li>
<li>create a profile for each platform/app/website you're storing the password of,</li>
<li>do all that with multiple emails(still not possible) and,</li>
<li>...not much else, really.</li>
You won't be able to jumble up your passwords, as this app finds the logo of the target platform/app/website with a staggering 60% accuracy!! And it shows it just above your password.

</br>And if you're in the situation of getting a new computer transferring passwords is <s>not yet possible, at all</s> as easy as 1, 2, 3! The steps are simple:
<li></li>

This project uses icons from flaticons,</br>python packages Selenium and requests,</br>and hopefully not much more!
